## Domain
Healthcare

## Problem Statement
Often in hospitals, we have a certain nurse to bed ratio set by the medical association of that country. It is almost never followed by hospitals as they aim to reduce employment costs. This decreases the ratio to a dangerous level where emergency patients, who need immediate attention, do not get it on time and in many cases, die out of improper time management of the hospital staff.
We know that in all hospitals, we have several kinds of beds, like some for general ward and maternity ward plus also for special ICUs and ICCUs. Each sector of the hospital has some or the other designated nursing stations where the nurses' house and then go to beds from there. Often they go on a timely schedule, and in an emergency if they get to see the certain patient or get to hear him/her. In big hospitals, there exists a central monitoring system, but systems like these have to be very costly.
