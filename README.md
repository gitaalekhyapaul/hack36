## Problem Statement
Often in hospitals, we have a certain nurse to bed ratio set by the medical association of that country. It is almost never followed by hospitals as they aim to reduce employment costs. This decreases the ratio to a dangerous level where emergency patients, who need immediate attention, do not get it on time and in many cases, die out of improper time management of the hospital staff.
We know that in all hospitals, we have several kinds of beds, like some for general ward and maternity ward plus also for special ICUs and ICCUs. Each sector of the hospital has some or the other designated nursing stations where the nurses' house and then go to beds from there. Often they go on a timely schedule, and in an emergency if they get to see the certain patient or get to hear him/her. In big hospitals, there exists a central monitoring system, but systems like these have to be very costly.

## Requirements
1. Libraries
2. NodeMCU Boards
3. Hardware Components

## Technology Stack
1. KOTLIN
2. Bootstrap w/ HTML+CSS

## Tasks Accomplished
- Raised proposal for a detection and sorting system.
- Placed a NodeMCU in the support and monitoring system which continuously monitors the patientâ€™s vitals and scores it in some form.
- Upon receiving a trigger, for example say on the account of an increased pulse rate, the system is able to send commands to the server, which in turn sends alerts to a nursing station nearby.
- The scoring system allows one to categorize patient beds and hospital sectors effortlessly.
- Efficiently predicts which Nursing Station is most busy or requires attention.
- Aforementioned Tasks accomplished wirelessly without changing the infrastructure of the hospital.
